    "lede": "The 2020 DNC Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) mandated an open, caucus-driven process to form West Virginiaâ€™s Affirmative Action Committee. The evidence proves this mandate was violated in two fundamental ways: first, organizers deliberately excluded 75% of the required minority caucuses, violating the MOU's 'caucus-first' principle. Second, they used a secret script, marked 'do not share,' to install a pre-selected slate of leaders, turning the election into a sham.",

        "summary": "The 2020 DNC agreement required a specific sequence: first, establish minority caucuses, and second, allow those caucuses to select their representatives for the committee. Organizers inverted this process. They formed the committee and installed its leadership before the Latino, AAPI, and Native American caucuses existed, denying those communities any role in the selection of their own representatives.",
