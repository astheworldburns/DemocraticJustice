    "summary": "Alabama’s elimination of caucuses produced a DNC order to restore them. West Virginia’s identical violation produced dismissal and personal blame. The difference was not the law, the facts, or the Charter — it was the complainant’s position within the Party’s hierarchy. This disparity reveals selective enforcement of participation rights under the same operative and standard."
