    <h1>About Democratic Justice: Why We Stand with WV Democrats</h1>

    <p>We tried working within the system. As Democrats in West Virginia, we filed grievances, raised concerns, and followed proper channels when we witnessed corruption and misconduct. Time after time, our individual efforts were dismissed, isolated, and quietly buried.</p>

    <h2>The Power of Proof</h2>
    <p>One person pointing out wrongdoing gets ignored. But a unified group with documented evidence cannot be dismissed so easily.</p>

    <p>Democratic Justice tackles what we believe holds West Virginia back: the lack of organized, fact-based accountability. We use a clear four-step method to build our cases. By focusing on evidence over emotion, we create an unshakeable foundation that others can rally behind.</p>

      <h2 id="context-title">Why “proof” matters in politics</h2>
      <p>In 1651, Thomas Hobbes built his argument for government like a mathematician builds a proof. Clear premises and visible steps lead to logical conclusions. We follow the same principle: show your work, trace your reasoning, let the facts speak. That's how real accountability begins.</p>
