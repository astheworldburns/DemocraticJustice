\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 13:52\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 members ex officio at large um and then your aac co-chairs and diversity at large you have 86 and then\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 13:59\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 when you add your officers onto that there's 15 officers um then you have 101. now keep in mind you\cb1 \

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 14:23\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 members who are officers that they're also elected so this number is not a static number it can it kind of changes\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 14:31\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 a little bit depending on who is elected uh officer\cb1 \

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 14:42\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 work with so if you look at your representative goal and this is easy because we have we\cb1 \

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 15:15\

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 19:20\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 know before the election of officers you could do it that way too that that's a decision for consideration\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 19:27\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 um another thing to consider is that the charter\cb1 \

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 requires that state parties carry out programs to increase the participation of low and moderate income um democrats\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 19:42\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 19:47\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 encourage people that typically just do not have the means normally to participate how can we encourage them to\cb1 \

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 19:54\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 participate in the program in terms of the timeline from the survey\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 20:19\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 20:55\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 affirmative action committee co-chairs are elected uh the bylaws say that that must be before the organizational\cb1 \

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 21:01\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 meeting and organizational meeting is basically just a meeting where they elect new officers and then around june or july is when\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 21:09\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 they will have their actual organization meeting and they'll elect at-large members officers and that sort of thing\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 21:14\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 so one of the big questions oh shoot\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 21:22\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 sorry um i lost my\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 slide um so one of the big questions is you know when will the diversity caucuses\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 21:35\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 21:41\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 to kind of keep in mind is the reason that the affirmative action co-chairs are elected\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 21:49\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 21:55\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 that they that the co-chairs um are um able to participate in selecting the\cb1 \

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 22:04\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 people who they will serve under the leadership that they will serve under and so that's something to consider um\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 22:11\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 about in the plan because there's nothing in the bylaws that talk about when diversity caucuses select their\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 22:17\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 leadership um and so if the diversity caucuses want to be a part of selecting the\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 22:24\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 leadership that they will serve under uh in terms of of the firm of action committee um that you know that's just\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 22:30\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 something to consider when do we want that you know when does the um they want that to be um\cb1 \

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 34:21\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 additional caucuses should be added i think they have the authority to do that\cb1 \

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 34:26\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 whether or not they should do that politically is another question but they certainly in my view have the authority\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 1:03:43\

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 1:32:50\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 think we might be the point now of where it's like a lot of the core is good but it's like we want to ensure that it's\cb1 \

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 1:33:14\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 1:33:19\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 they think about looking over this and then figuring out ways to like you know streamline that from that but i mean very good like you know content\cb1 \

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 1:59:49\

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 2:00:26\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 makes perfect sense because i think there might be a better way to say that but i think the reason we used federal system was because of\cb1 \

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 2:00:31\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 2:02:38\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 um one of the last questions um\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 2:02:44\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 is about uh the west virginia state party uh and requesting information about diversity representation um and\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 2:02:51\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 those exact numbers is that something that the planning committee is interested in engaging with actually\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 2:02:57\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 getting the hard numbers about um who's represented at a state level\cb1 \

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 2:03:02\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 i think it makes sense and it's probably information we should already have to be doing this work we just we just don't have it\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 2:03:10\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 and how should we make that request if that's something we want to do\cb1 \

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 2:03:15\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 would that be kurt's department because does the executive director kind of do more record keeping\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 yeah i mean that makes sense but i'm not completely sure it's definitely a correct question right i think that might be the thing to\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 2:03:32\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 2:03:39\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 \cb6 in the right direction or everything because i'm thinking with that data also because we're talking about like accessibility of like you know the information we're creating and stuff\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 2:03:45\
